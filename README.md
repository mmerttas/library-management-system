# library-management-system

 In this code, which is actually the final project of my C programming class, my teammate and I have aimed to create a Library Management System which has a simple interface and is efficient just by using the knowledge that we have learned in this class. This program has mainly three menus which are the welcome menu, admins general menu, and user menu. Using these menus you can manage basic tasks that are usually done in library systems like finding books, borrowing books and returning them, creating accounts and managing them, etc.
 
 All the necessary files have been added. Detailed information can be reached via https://youtu.be/fW3di4sy8lg .
